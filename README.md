Stand-alone C++ decoder for RNN-based NMT models. Can decode with default
models from Marian and Nematus.

This tool was a part of [Marian](https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian), which
now has its own decoder. Therefore, _amun_ has been moved to a separate
repository. For RNN models this decoder can still be faster on the GPU than the
official Marian decoder.
